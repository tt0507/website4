      <p> Where: Klarman Hall Atrium (Temple of Zeus) </p>
      <p>When: Bi-weekly on Sundays at 11:30 am </p>

      <p> What: At meetings, all you need to bring is yourself! We will provide the coffee and the gear. Fun is mandatory. Coffee Club also goes on field trips! they are in touch with local coffee companies and believe that local outreach is an integral part of the coffee education experience. In the Fall 2018 semester, Coffee Club has attended the Gimme! Coffee Latte Art Throwdown, as well as visited Jesse at Copper Horse Coffee Roasters. </p>
