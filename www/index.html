			<h1> Our Mission </h1>
			<p>Cornell Coffee Club seeks to bring people together who are passionate about coffee! To participate, one does not necessarily need to enjoy drinking coffee, but be ready to engage in a discussion about historical, cultural, and socio-economic factors on all steps of the coffee production (from bean to cup). Coffee Club seeks to bring individuals together to form an inclusive and welcoming community through education, community outreach, and hands-on experience.
			</p>
			<p> Come have a cup of coffee with us! Contact one of our team members to join in.</p>
